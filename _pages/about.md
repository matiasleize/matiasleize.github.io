I'm a PhD. student interested in Cosmological data and statistical analysis

My work
======

During my M.S. and the first year of my PhD. I studied a family of alternative cosmological theories to the standard cosmological model $\Lambda \rm{CDM}$, which are called $f(R)$ theories. In particular, I studied the Hu-Sawicki and the exponential model in the scope of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) fluxes, which is a high redshift data available to test cosmological models. You can find this work [here](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.105.103526).

Besides, I've also been studying and testing other kinds of modified theories. For instance, I worked on the developing of a modification of the [CLASS code](https://lesgourg.github.io/class_public/class.html), in which a Vector Field Dark Matter model was implemented (this work and repo will be available soon). 

I'm currently studying statistical metrics which help to evaluate the tension between posterior distribution using cosmological data. Recently we assess the tension between SH0ES collaboration cepheids data + Pantheon Plus and The Cosmic Chronometers dataset, in which we encountered a signifiant tension between datasets. For more information, you can find this article [here](https://arxiv.org/2312.08542).
