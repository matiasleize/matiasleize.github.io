I'm a PhD. student interested in Cosmological data and statistical analysis

My work
======

During my M.S. and the first year of my PhD. degree I studied $f(R)$ theories, which are a modification to the standard cosmological model $\Lambda \rm{CDM}$. In particular, I studied the Hu-Sawicki and the exponential model $f(R)$ theories in the scope of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) flux data, which is a high redshift data used to test cosmological models.

I am currently studying statistical metrics which help to evaluate the tension between posterior distribution using cosmological data.
